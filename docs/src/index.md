# tJMagnonHolon

*t-J model in magnon-holon basis.*

A set of modules for t-J model (related) Hamiltonians diagonalization and various correlation functions generation.

## Features

- Generate sparse matrix of t-J model Hamiltonian in magnon-holon basis.
- Generate full (small systems) or partial (large systems) set of eigen-values and related eigen-vectors of t-J model.
- Calculate operators action on wave functions in magnon-holon basis.
- Calculate correlation functions for the t-J model.
- Save data to JSON files and use them as data sets in Mathematica, R, Python, etc.

The [Guide](@ref) provides a tutorial explaining how to use above features.
You will find there practical examples on how to run your calculations or how to extend the existing code base with your own operators.

In the [Advanced](@ref) section you can find technical discussion of the mathematics behind various features of the code.

See [Documentation](@ref) for the raw list of documented modules and features.
