# tJMagnonHolon

*t-J model in magnon-holon basis.*

A set of modules for t-J model (related) Hamiltonians diagonalization and various spectral functions generation.

## Features

- Generate sparse matrix of t-J model Hamiltonian in magnon-holon basis.
- Generate full (small systems) or partial (large systems) set of eigen-values and related eigen-vectors of t-J model.
- Calculate operators action on wave functions in magnon-holon basis.
- Calculate Greens functions and spectral functions of t-J model.
- Save data to JSON files and use them as data sets in Mathematica, R, Python, etc.

## Guide

The **Guide** provides a tutorial explaining how start using above features.
You will find there practical examples for running your calculations or how to extend the existing code base with your own operators.

See the **Documentation** section for the complete list of documented modules and features.

In the **Advanced** section you can find technical discussion e.g. of the mathematics behind various features of the code.
